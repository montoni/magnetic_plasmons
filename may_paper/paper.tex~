Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
Society}.

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
separate page at the end of the document.

\includegraphics[width=.65\paperwidth]{magnetic_mode_eigenvalues_and_interactions.png}
\caption{Magnetic mode eigenvalues (column a), predicted and simulated, and interaction strengths (column b) for the magnetic twomer (first row), threemer chain (second row), and threemer ring (third row). All of the magnetic modes range from ~3.6 eV to ~3.1 eV. In each system, the magnetic modes exhibit multiple crossings, showing that the eigenspectrum of these magnetic systems depends on their scale. The model consistently overestimates the eigenvalues by 0.5 eV, and consistently underestimates the crossing points by less than a nanometer. The twomer has two magnetic modes, one in-phase mode (blue trace) and one out-of-phase mode (orange trace). The threemer chain has three modes, an in-phase mode (blue trace), a minimally out-of-phase mode (orange trace), and a maximally out-of-phase mode (green trace). The threemer ring exhibits three magnetic modes, but the out-of-phase modes (orange trace) are degenerate so only one is depicted. The other mode is a maximally in-phase mode (blue trace). To further emphasize the impact of scale, we have plotted the total interaction strength of each eigenmode, \textit{i.e.} the sum of each eigenvector's dot product with the electric field of all of the other dipoles. This calculation reaffirms the scale dependence and predicts mode crossings at the same scale as both the eigenvalue calculation and the simulations.}

\caption{Magnetic mode eigenvalues for twomers (first row), threemer chains (second row), and threemer rings (third row) with particle sizes of 15 nm (column a) and 30 nm (column b) as a function of the dielectric constant of an embedding medium. As the dielectric constant is increased from 1 to 3, the magnetic mode splitting decreases and the overall energy decreases. At very high dielectric values, the magnetic mode eigenvalues converge to the single particle resonance frequency. This can be explained by the increasing opacity of the medium effectively screening inter-particle interactions. It is also important to note that between $\varepsilon_b = 1$ and $\varepsilon_b = 1.5$, the magnetic modes flip order. Thus, the increasing opacity of the medium effectively decreases the scale of the system.}

\caption{Magnetic mode eigenvalues for twomers (first row), threemer chains (second row), and threemer rings (third row) with particle sizes of 15 nm (column a) and 30 nm (column b) as a function of nearest neighbor particle spearation. The separation is plotted as a function of the particle size, in units of radii. It is important to note that as the separation distance increases, the magnetic modes cross multiple times and their eigenvalues converge to, and oscillate about the single particle frequency. This is a result of the decreasing interaction strength. In the limit of particles infinitely far away from each other, their interaction stength is zero. The oscillating nature of the eigenvalues is a result of the complex exponential dependence of the fields.}

\includegraphics{dimer_interaction.png}
\caption{Relative interaction strengths for the four possible dipole arrangements of a nanoparticle dimer: collinear (a), parallel (b), anti-collinear (c), and anti-parallel (d). Plotted are the near-field (blue), intermediate-field (orange), far-field (green), and total (black, dashed) interaction strengths for each set of dipoles as a function of dipole-dipole distance. Interestingly, and stemming from the form of the dipole relay tensor, the far-field interaction term is zero for both pairs of linear dipoles. From these plots, it can be seen that the favorability of a specific dipole arrangement depends on the separation between the dipoles. This can be seen in the fact that each part of the field depends differently on the separation, and each field term contains an oscillating term. At short length scales, the interaction is dominated by the near-field. However, as the distance increases, the interaction is dominated by the intermediate-field (a and c) or the far-field (b and d). As a result, there are separation distances at which normally unfavorable arrangements become favorable. Since magnetic oligomers can be described through pairwise interactions of electric dipoles, it follows that the eigenvalues must also change order as different arrangements of electric dipoles become more and less favorable.}

\subsection{Outline}

The document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned.
Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the
normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be
given if these should not be present.

\subsection{References}

The class makes various changes to the way that references are
handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
citation style
\cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003,Friedman-Hill2003,EuropeanCommission2008}.
The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
supplementary information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}. If you
encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.

Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} package
\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.
Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated
with a star. If the \textsf{mciteplus} package is not installed,
the standard bibliography tools will still work but starred
references will be ignored. Individual references can be referred
to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.

The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.

\subsection{Floats}

New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
means graphics are included as follows (Scheme~\ref{sch:example}).  As
illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
\begin{scheme}
  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files:\\
  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
  %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \caption{An example scheme}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}

\begin{figure}
  As well as the standard float types \texttt{table}\\
  and \texttt{figure}, the class also recognises\\
  \texttt{scheme}, \texttt{chart} and \texttt{graph}.
  \caption{An example figure}
  \label{fgr:example}
\end{figure}

Charts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or
captioned.  However, tables should always have a title. It is
possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any
title, using an empty argument to the \texttt{\textbackslash caption}
macro.

The use of the different floating environments is not required, but
it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In
general, you should place your graphics where they make logical
sense; the production process will move them if needed.

\subsection{Math(s)}

The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
support for mathematics.  If packages such as \textsf{amsmath} are
required, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
the basic \LaTeX\ math(s) input should work correctly without
this.  Some inline material \( y = mx + c \) or $ 1 + 1 = 2 $
followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

It is possible to label equations in the usual way (Eq.~\ref{eqn:example}).
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \, r^2 = 2r \label{eqn:example}
\end{equation}
This can also be used to have equations containing graphical
content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic,
rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.80\linewidth}
    \centering
    As illustrated here, the width of \\
    the minipage needs to allow some  \\
    space for the number to fit in to.
    %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \end{minipage}
  \label{eqn:graphic}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental}

The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
include a table, which can be referenced as Table~\ref{tbl:example}.
Notice that the caption is positioned at the top of the table.
\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one  & Header two  \\
    \hline
    Entry one   & Entry two   \\
    Entry three & Entry four  \\
    Entry five  & Entry five  \\
    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
method is to generate these using the basic
\texttt{\textbackslash textsuperscript} and
\texttt{\textbackslash emph} macros, as illustrated (Table~\ref{tbl:notes}).
\begin{table}
  \caption{A table with notes}
  \label{tbl:notes}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one                            & Header two \\
    \hline
    Entry one\textsuperscript{\emph{a}}   & Entry two  \\
    Entry three\textsuperscript{\emph{b}} & Entry four \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \textsuperscript{\emph{a}} Some text;
  \textsuperscript{\emph{b}} Some more text.
\end{table}

The example file also loads the optional \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}}
gives \ce{H2SO4}.  See the use in the bibliography file (when using
titles in the references section).

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process.  For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
to give italic, mono-spaced text: \mycommand{some text}.

\section{Extra information when writing JACS Communications}

When producing communications for \emph{J.~Am.\ Chem.\ Soc.}, the
class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the
journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be
accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in
mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way.  The layout
produced here is a \emph{model} for the published result, and the
outcome should be taken as a \emph{guide} to the final length. The
spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is
some flexibility in the process.  You should not worry about the
space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the
published size. This is very dependant on the final published layout.

You should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS
Communication and a normal article.  For example, this demonstration
file will work with both \texttt{type=article} and
\texttt{type=communication}. Sections and any abstract are
automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.
